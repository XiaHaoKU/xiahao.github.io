## About Me

I am an interdisciplinary conservation geographer, trained in conservation and land system science, and ecological economics. In my work, I integrate methodologies from remote sensing, econometrics, spatial ecology, social-ecological networks, and conservation planning to gain insights into coupled human-nature systems.

My ongoing Ph.D. project focuses on integrating remote sensing observations, socioeconomic information, and robust econometric causal inference to assess the effects of conservation initiatives (including protected areas and ecological function zones) on <a href="https://www.ipbes.net/glossary-tag/natures-contributions-people" target="_blank"> nature's contributions to people</a> and human well-being, while also developing systematic conservation planning to identify conservation priorities.

I am currently working as a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://ign.ku.dk/english/research/geography/environment-society-developing-countries/" target="_blank"> Environment and Society Group</a> at the University of Copenhagen under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://ign.ku.dk/english/employees/geography/?pure=en/persons/501467" target="_blank"> Alexander Prishchepov</a>. I completed my master's degree in Land Economics and bachelor's degree in Land Resource Management.


## Research Interests
- **Conservation assessment:** Evaluating the impacts of conservation/development initiatives on ecosystem services and human well-being
- **Spatial planning:** Spatial prioritization in systematic conservation planning
- **Land use/land cover:** Social-ecological consequences of land use/land cover change


## News
- **[Oct. 2023] Attended the GSC Conference** - I recently participated in the GSC Conference hosted by the University of Copenhagen's Green Solutions Centre. This event brought together sustainability experts to discuss innovative environmental solutions.

- **[Sept. 2023] Presented Research at the 52nd GfÖ Annual Meeting** - I presented <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110254" target="_blank"> our research</a>, published in Biological Conservation, at the 52nd <a href="https://www.gfoe-conference.de/index.php?cat=show_start" target="_blank"> Annual Meeting</a> of the Ecological Society of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland (GfÖ) in Leipzig hosted by <a href="https://www.idiv.de/en/index.html" target="_blank"> iDiv</a>.

- **[Sept. 2023] Dive into Biodiversity at the Blue-Green Biodiversity Summer School!**

This month, I had the privilege of attending the Blue-Green Biodiversity Summer School, co-organized by the <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en/" target="_blank"> WSL</a> Biodiversity Center and the <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en/about-wsl/organisation/programmes-and-initiatives/blue-green-biodiversity-research-initiative/"> Blue-Green Biodiversity Research Initiative</a>. This exceptional summer school featured outstanding speakers and an enriching program, all set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Swiss Alps.  
During this immersive experience, I engaged in discussions with seasoned researchers and peers, delving deep into the fascinating world of biodiversity. The program allowed us to explore the intricate connections between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems while highlighting the interdependencies between social and ecological systems.  
It was a truly remarkable opportunity to expand my knowledge and gain insights into the complexities of biodiversity, all in the heart of the stunning Swiss Alps.
